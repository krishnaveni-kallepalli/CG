stashing senario:
when we switch the branch without commit, it won't let you switch between branches 
it'll throw below error 
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
        hello.html
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting

if it switches...
the changes are not staged, you can switch and commit the changes it previous branch where changes are done



git stash - saves our changes in stash but not applied 
it'll be back to previous commit changes but saves the changes done  
save changes without commit 

gto saveit stash pop
remove most recently stashed changes and apply to working copy(added changes back in from where it was stashed).
